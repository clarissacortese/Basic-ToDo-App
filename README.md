# Basic To-Do App

I have created this simple app using React and Vite. It serves as a basic exercise for utilizing React with the useState hook and for passing props from parent elements to child elements and vice versa. For the interface, I've chosen Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
